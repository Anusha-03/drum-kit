1. if we add () parantheses to handleClick in the addEventListener then, the function gets called as we hit refresh and not on clicking 'w'.
2. replace handleClick by an anonymous function with the same functionality
3. 'this' keyword is the identity of the button that triggers the event listener.
4. constructor function 
function BellBoy(name1, age1, hasWorkPermit1, languages1) {
    this.name = name1;
    this.age = age1;
    this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit1;
    this.languages = languages1;
}
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy", "19", true, ["English", "French"]);
